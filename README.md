# Occupancy
This repository contains research into using tools written in the R programming language to model dynamic occupancy based on camera trap detection data. Occupancy is defined as the probability that a particular site will contain a particular entity (i.e: an animal species in an ecological study), and it is made "dynamic" or "multi-season" by modeling occupancy (and its changes) over time.

Our research data comes from camera trap studies performed on mammals in the lowland and cloud forests of Costa Rica.
